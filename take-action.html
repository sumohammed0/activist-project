            Would you be able to deal with an empty stomach? Could you live off
            of canned foods and bars? Could you eat cold hard food gratefully?
          </p>
          <p>
            You were lucky enough to be privileged. Now use your privilege to
            help others. The homeless, the hungry, the sick. No matter their
            circumstances, they are all human. They are you, you are them. A
            little bit will go a long way.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are several organizations in place that will provide food to
            food banks, deliver food to the helpless, and will let you do the
            same. Bring your family, friends, the whole community together and
            take that one step towards a better society.
          </p>
          <p>
            1) Start off by raising awareness. Get people to recognize the
            severity of the problem. Make them understand just how many human
            beings are going hungry and struggling to make ends meet.
          </p>
          <p>
            2) Donate money. ONE dollar can provide TEN meals. A childâ€™s
            allowance can provide 100 meals. Go to Feeding America and donate.
          </p>
          <p>
            3) Volunteer your time. Help out in food banks through Feeding
            America. Help deliver meals to seniors through Meals on Wheels.
            Volunteer at ICNA relief USA who provide meals in downtown dallas to
            those in need. There are so many ways to help. Do your research and
            step out!
          </p>
          <p>
            4) Get a group together. Cook some wholesome healthy food to pass
            out in downtown. Dallas City Hall has provided a guide for feeding
            the homeless. Follow the instructions and help alleviate the
            problem.
